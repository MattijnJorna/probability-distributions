\begin{exercise}
	\textbf{[BH.37]}  $T\sim \Exp\lambda$ is the time until a radioactive particle decays.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item First answer the original questions in your own words.		
		\item Additionally, consider now that $T_1, \ldots, T_n \sim \Exp{\lambda/n}$ to make sure the total amount of expected decays is fixed. What is the probability that there happen to be $k$ decays in the time $[0,t]$ and what happens to this probability if we let $n\rightarrow\infty$? (You can use the fact that $\frac{n!}{n^k (n-k)!} \rightarrow 1$ and $n^k (1-e^{-a/n})^k \rightarrow a^k$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$)
	\end{enumerate}
